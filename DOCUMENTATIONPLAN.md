##Summary 

This document outlines my complete documentation strategy for Protekt, a fictional authentication SaaS platform. The approach focuses on three key outcomes: fast developer adoption (integration in <10 minutes), deep product usage (>60% feature adoption), and reduced support costs (30% fewer tickets).

The strategy is built on understanding the developer journey, creating progressive documentation that meets developers where they are, and establishing scalable processes for ongoing maintenance.

## Assumptions
For this project, I've made the following assumptions about Protekt:

### Product
- Protekt is an authentication SaaS similar to Auth0 or Firebase Auth
- Offers OAuth 2.0, MFA, social login, user management APIs
- Target users: developers integrating authentication into web/mobile apps
- Freemium pricing model

### Documentation Context
- Starting from minimal/no existing documentation
- Small engineering team, 2-3 product managers
- Goal: Enable self-service, reduce support tickets by 30%
- Timeline: 6-8 weeks for initial rollout

## Developer Journey

Developers move through 5 phases, each requiring different documentation:

**1. Discovery (30 seconds)**
- Need: Clear value proposition, comparison to alternatives
- Content: Landing page, "Why Protekt?", use cases

**2. Exploration (2-5 minutes)**
- Need: Understanding how it works, see examples
- Content: Architecture overview, live demos, code previews

**3. First Integration (10-30 minutes)**
- Need: Working authentication ASAP
- Content: Quickstart guide, framework-specific tutorials
- Success: User authenticates successfully in <10 minutes

**4. Deep Implementation (days-weeks)**
- Need: Implement specific features
- Content: MFA guide, social login, session management, custom UI
- Success: Developer implements 3+ features

**5. Production (ongoing)**
- Need: Security, optimization, troubleshooting
- Content: Best practices, debugging, monitoring
