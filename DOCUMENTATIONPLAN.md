# Protekt Documentation Project - Strategic Plan

**Author:** Dubem Obinna-Esiowu

## Summary 

This document outlines my complete documentation strategy for Protekt, a fictional authentication SaaS platform. The approach focuses on three key outcomes: fast developer adoption (integration in <10 minutes), deep product usage (>60% feature adoption), and reduced support costs (30% fewer tickets).

The strategy is built on understanding the developer journey, creating progressive documentation that meets developers where they are, and establishing scalable processes for ongoing maintenance.

## Assumptions
For this project, I've made the following assumptions about Protekt:

### Product
- Protekt is an authentication SaaS similar to Auth0 or Firebase Auth
- Offers OAuth 2.0, MFA, social login, user management APIs
- Target users: developers integrating authentication into web/mobile apps
- Freemium pricing model

### Documentation Context
- Starting from minimal/no existing documentation
- Small engineering team, 2-3 product managers
- Goal: Enable self-service, reduce support tickets by 30%
- Timeline: 6-8 weeks for initial rollout

---

## Developer Journey

Developers move through 5 phases, each requiring different documentation:

**1. Discovery (30 seconds)**
- Need: Clear value proposition, comparison to alternatives
- Content: Landing page, "Why Protekt?", use cases

**2. Exploration (2-5 minutes)**
- Need: Understanding how it works, see examples
- Content: Architecture overview, live demos, code previews

**3. First Integration (10-30 minutes)**
- Need: Working authentication ASAP
- Content: Quickstart guide, framework-specific tutorials
- Success: User authenticates successfully in <10 minutes

**4. Deep Implementation (days-weeks)**
- Need: Implement specific features
- Content: MFA guide, social login, session management, custom UI
- Success: Developer implements 3+ features

**5. Production (ongoing)**
- Need: Security, optimization, troubleshooting
- Content: Best practices, debugging, monitoring

## Information Architecture

> **Getting Started**
> - Welcome
> - Quickstart (<10 min)
> - Core Concepts

> **Guides**
> - Integration (Web, Mobile, Backend)
> - Features (MFA, Social Login, Sessions)
> - Security Best Practices

> **API Reference**
> - Authentication API
> - User Management
> - Webhooks

> **SDKs & Tools**
> - JavaScript, Python, Go
> - CLI

> **Troubleshooting**
> - Common Errors
> - Debug Mode
> - FAQ

**Design Principles:**
- Task-oriented organization (how to do X, not what is X)
- Progressive disclosure (simple → advanced)
- Code-first approach (show, then explain)
- Clear prerequisites for each guide

---

## Content Strategy

### Writing Principles

**1. Developer-First**
- Code examples before explanations
- Copy-paste ready snippets
- Working examples, not pseudocode

**2. Action-Oriented**
- Titles: "Implementing MFA" not "MFA Overview"
- Focus on tasks, not features
- Clear success criteria

**3. Progressive Disclosure**
- Start simple, link to advanced
- Required vs optional content separated
- Expandable sections for details

**4. Scannable**
- Short paragraphs (3-4 lines max)
- Descriptive headings
- Bullet points for lists
- Code blocks stand out

### Content Templates

> **Feature Guide Structure:**

> - **Title** (action-oriented)
> - **Overview** (what you'll learn, time estimate)
> - **Prerequisites** (with links)
> - **Step-by-step instructions**
> - **Code examples** (tested and working)
> - **Troubleshooting**
> - **Best practices**
> - **Next steps**

**Example Quality Standards:**

- Technical accuracy verified by engineering
- All code examples tested
- Screenshots current
- Links functional
- Follows style guide

## Platform Implementation

### Why Docusaurus

**Technical Requirements:**
- Versioning (for API docs)
- Search functionality
- Fast performance
- Easy contribution workflow

**Docusaurus Delivers:**
- Open-source, proven at scale (Meta, Supabase, Jest)
- Built-in versioning
- Algolia search integration
- MDX for interactive components
- Non-developers can contribute via Markdown
- Excellent SEO and performance

**Alternatives Considered:**
- GitBook: Good but costly at scale
- Custom solution: Too much maintenance overhead
- ReadTheDocs: Less flexible for modern needs

### Technical Stack
- Platform: Docusaurus
- Hosting: Vercel/Netlify (auto-deploy from Git)
- Version Control: GitHub
- Search: Algolia DocSearch
- Analytics: Track page views, search queries, time-on-page

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Research & Planning**
- Interview 5-7 existing customers about integration experience
- Analyze support tickets for top pain points
- Review competitor documentation (Auth0, Firebase, Clerk)

**Deliverables:**
- Developer personas
- Top 10 support issues analysis
- Content inventory

### Phase 2: Core Content (Weeks 3-4)
**High-Priority Documentation**
- Welcome/Introduction
- Quickstart guide
- Top 3 integration guides (Web, Mobile, Backend)
- MFA implementation guide

**Quality Process:**
1. Draft with code examples
2. Test all code
3. Engineering review
4. Edit for clarity
5. Final approval

**Deliverables:**
- 8-10 complete guides
- 30+ tested code examples
- Style guide

### Phase 3: Platform & Launch (Weeks 5-6)
**Setup & Deploy**
- Configure Docusaurus
- Implement navigation and search
- Set up analytics
- Deploy to production
- Soft launch to existing users

**Deliverables:**
- Live documentation site
- Analytics dashboard
- Feedback collection system

### Phase 4: Scale & Maintain (Ongoing)
**PM Enablement**
- Train PMs on documentation workflow
- Establish review process
- Create templates

**Continuous Improvement**
- Weekly: Fix reported issues, update outdated content
- Monthly: Review analytics, identify gaps
- Quarterly: Content audit, structure review
